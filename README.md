# Linear Regression and Data Analysis on Insurance Dataset

This repository contains Python code for performing linear regression and data analysis on an insurance dataset. The dataset contains information about individuals' insurance expenses, including various features such as age, BMI, gender, number of children, smoking status, and region.

## Contents

1. **Data Exploration:**
    - The code loads the insurance dataset and performs initial data exploration, including displaying the first few rows of the dataset.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
    - It includes data preprocessing steps such as transforming the 'expenses' column using square root and logarithm to handle skewed data distributions. Additionally, it converts categorical variables into dummy variables.

3. **Linear Regression Model:**
    - The code builds a linear regression model using the scikit-learn library. It splits the dataset into training and testing sets, fits the model to the training data, and makes predictions.

4. **Model Evaluation:**
    - The code evaluates the linear regression model's performance by calculating metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and the R-squared score.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/insurance-linear-regression.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd insurance-linear-regression
   ```

3. Run the Python script to perform linear regression and data analysis on the insurance dataset:
   ```bash
   python insurance_linear_regression.py
   ```

4. View the results and visualizations in the script's output.
